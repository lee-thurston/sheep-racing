# Sheep Racing

Sheep Racing is an Azure Static Web app which connects to a Mongo DB in Azure.

The idea behind this is that it is used to keep track of race results and gives racers a rating based off of the results.

Users login and signup via twitch, and usually only select twitch accounts can create race results, but this has been disabled for demo purposes.

This project is constantly updated, so everything (especially the UI) is probably temporary.

The site is hosted at: http://www.sheep-racing.co.uk
